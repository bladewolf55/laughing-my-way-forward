                <div class='post-content'><p>Yesterday I applied for a job and got scheduled for an interview within an hour. Today I was supposed to have that interview. It got rescheduled.</p>
<p>Where's the humor in that?</p>

<p>At the time there wasn't much. It was kind of deflating. Definitely fed the depression cloud. The interviewer didn't let me know. I contacted <em>her</em> when she was ten minutes late. Not a great impression.</p>
<p>But you know what? I have no idea what was happening in her day. Sure, it could be she'd had a bad day with no coffee, or has CUFV<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Or, it could be far, far worse.</p>
<p>She may have come under siege by Phantom Mole Men.</p>
<p>Unknown to most of you out there, Phantom Mole Men are a real problem, an insidious plague in the lives of those who cross their paths. These creatures, barely human, invisible to the eye<a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, prey on folks--this could be you!--who sprinkle licorice Jimmies on chocolate ice cream, or prepare their taxes in early February, or carry a compact umbrella <em>just because</em>.</p>
<p>Superman faced them. You can see surprisingly well-lit live news footage of those encounters if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QygK8gYl-2M">know where to look</a>. Everyone who wore gray-scale clothes thought we'd seen the last of the fiends, but they hadn't disappeared. They'd merely vanished! Probably through the power of sub-terrestrial science, which my eighth grade teacher Mrs Glanderspoot warned me about when I kept hiding earthworms in Marla Flitkin's lunch bag.</p>
<p>But if they can't be seen (except as indicated in the footnotes. Hi, Aunt F.!), how do I know they exist at all? Because, they hide in plain sight. Here is a recent photograph of one of those infernals, masquerading as a common citizen.</p>

<p>If you see this nondescript gent attempting to blend into a crowd, run! Escape with your life!</p>
<p>The PMMs are real, my friends. Fortunately they only harass their victims for a maximum of two hours and twenty seven minutes at a time every three years. No one knows why, but some day, with your financial help, we may find out.</p>
<p>This is why I'm not too concerned about having a successful rescheduled interview. My job seekee won't be afflicted, and neither will I because I'm buying a gila monster tomorrow.</p>

                <div class='post-content'><p>Today I not only left my job, I left my career of almost 30 years. Maybe not permanently; that remains to be seen. But what do you think? My resignation email went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main reason I'm leaving is that I don't like this profession anymore. I dread starting my day, and my wife dreads hearing me talk about my job. That feeling has grown over the years and it's become too strong to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a lot of interests, among them the science of well-being. I love the smartphone app <a href="https://centerhealthyminds.org/join-the-movement/healthy-minds-app-provides-relief-from-pandemic-stress">Healthy Minds</a>. It's a terrific, comprehensive program of evidence-based practices. There's an additional series of lessons, <em>Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness</em>. I've held off on this particular series because I'm a science guy, not a religion guy, and yes I know the position that Buddhism is a philosophy, and I'm not arguing that one way or the other. And the reason the Dalai Lama's featured in the app at all is that he's worked directly with Dr Richard Davidson, a world-renowned neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, to help understand what makes people happy.</p>
<p>So, science.</p>
<p>What matters is that in the very first lesson, when His Holiness is introduced, he's laughing. Here's a picture. He's the dude on the right.</p>

<p>This really struck me. You see, I suffer from chronic depression. It's--clinically speaking--mild most of the time, but has become worse over the last several years, impacting my job and marriage. You might think I grew up in a dour family full of strict protocols and cobwebby, dank conversations. But I didn't. My relatives love to laugh. I had a reasonably normal childhood and early adulthood, except for the part where I was surrounded by brilliant artists and super-smart minds. (Well, that was normal to <em>me</em>.)</p>
<p>Depression does have an environmental component; our surroundings affect our thinking. Yet it's the brain's chemistry that leans some toward Mt Doom. As my therapist put it, we depressed folks have an ever-present gray cloud near us. That will never go away. What we control is whether we feed the cloud or starve it.</p>

<p>Here's a great exercise that my wife had me do. It doesn't have to take long.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the things about your job you like and don't like.</li>
<li>Indicate which things are inherent to the job.</li>
</ol>
<p>This only took me about fifteen minutes. In my case, I discovered that half of what I didn't like was also inherent to the job and the field. I told my wife I <em>used</em> to like those parts of the job, but not anymore. That's when my situation clicked for her and me. Of <em>course</em> I was unhappy. I was doing things I couldn't enjoy and weren't going to go away.</p>
<p>Am I recommending dropping whatever you're doing and following your bliss? No, at least not on a whim. Be responsible. Be thoughtful. Don't trade one set of suffering for another unless it's a good trade. My situation isn't yours. I have conditional support from my wife of the &quot;OK, I trust you, I want you to be happy and you haven't been which isn't fun for me or why I married you, but you can't be unemployed for long and we do have a nice house, a dog to feed, and retirement to think of&quot; kind.</p>
<p>What I learned today is I need to get back to laughing and doing fun things with people. Life isn't all Gummi Bears and puppy piles. My storm cloud is ever-demanding to be fed. But some good belly-rockers are just the way to starve it.</p>
