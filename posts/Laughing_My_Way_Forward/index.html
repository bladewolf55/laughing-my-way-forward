                <div class='post-content'><p>Today I not only left my job, I left my career of almost 30 years. Maybe not permanently; that remains to be seen. But what do you think? My resignation email went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main reason I'm leaving is that I don't like this profession anymore. I dread starting my day, and my wife dreads hearing me talk about my job. That feeling has grown over the years and it's become too strong to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a lot of interests, among them the science of well-being. I love the smartphone app <a href="https://centerhealthyminds.org/join-the-movement/healthy-minds-app-provides-relief-from-pandemic-stress">Healthy Minds</a>. It's a terrific, comprehensive program of evidence-based practices. There's an additional series of lessons, <em>Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness</em>. I've held off on this particular series because I'm a science guy, not a religion guy, and yes I know the position that Buddhism is a philosophy, and I'm not arguing that one way or the other. And the reason the Dalai Lama's featured in the app at all is that he's worked directly with Dr Richard Richard Davidson, a world-renowned neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, to help understand what makes people happy.</p>
<p>So, science.</p>
<p>What matters is that in the very first lesson, when His Holiness is introduced, he's laughing. Here's a picture. He's the dude on the right.</p>

<p>This really struck me. You see, I suffer from chronic depression. It's--clinically speaking--mild most of the time, but has become worse over the last several years, impacting my job and marriage. You might think I grew up in a dour family full of strict protocols and cobwebby, dank conversations. But I didn't. My relatives love to laugh. I had a reasonably normal childhood and early adulthood, except for the part where I was surrounded by brilliant artists and super-smart minds. (Well, that was normal to <em>me</em>.)</p>
<p>Depression does have an environmental component; our surroundings affect our thinking. Yet it's the brain's chemistry that leans some toward Mt Doom. As my therapist put it, we depressed folks have an ever-present gray cloud near us. That will never go away. What we control is whether we feed the cloud or starve it.</p>

<p>Here's a great exercise that my wife had me do. It doesn't have to take long.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the things about your job you like and don't like.</li>
<li>Indicate which things are inherent to the job.</li>
</ol>
<p>This only took me about fifteen minutes. In my case, I discovered that half of what I didn't like was also inherent to the job and the field. I told my wife I <em>used</em> to like those parts of the job, but not anymore. That's when my situation clicked for her and me. Of <em>course</em> I was unhappy. I was doing things I couldn't enjoy and weren't going to go away.</p>
<p>Am I recommending dropping whatever you're doing and following your bliss? No, at least not on a whim. Be responsible. Be thoughtful. Don't trade one set of suffering for another unless it's a good trade. My situation isn't yours. I have conditional support from my wife of the &quot;OK, I trust you, I want you to be happy and you haven't been which isn't fun for me or why I married you, but you can't be unemployed for long and we do have a nice house, a dog to feed, and retirement to think of&quot; kind.</p>
<p>What I learned today is I need to get back to laughing and doing fun things with people. Life isn't all Gummi Bears and puppy piles. My storm cloud is ever-demanding to be fed. But some good belly-rockers are just the way to starve it.</p>
