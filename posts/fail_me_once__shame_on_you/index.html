                <div class='post-content'><p>What do you do when the person who scheduled your phone interview doesn't call you <em>for a second time</em>?</p>
<p>Well, what I did after fifteen minutes was turn off my headset, resolve to ignore any calls, and applied for the same position at another franchise location.</p>
<p>What will I do if the person contacts me, apologizes, asks to try again? Probably tell the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't show up for two interviews. That tells me I shouldn't work with you, no matter what the reasons.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Fail me twice, shame on you twice as much, and shame on me if I give you another chance.</em> This is, after all, not a marriage or a child. It's a low-paying job to get my foot in the door and it's not the only door in town.</p>
<p>I also applied to a different job teaching fitness classes for seniors. Since I'm a senior, that's probably a good fit.</p>
<p>On the home front, my wife and I played <a href="https://bananagrams.com/"><em>Bananagrams</em></a> tonight. I told her and myself and the Cosmos that I didn't expect to win, I wouldn't win, and I didn't win. Her vocabulary and experience at words games is just too much.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.laughingmywayforward.com/posts/fail_me_once__shame_on_you/2023-03-06-20-04-31.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It's a good game, but not for us, not for now, not in the &quot;it makes me laugh&quot; kind of way I want to be playing.</p>
<p>We're still on the hunt.</p>
<p>This is my advice. Find a game you enjoy playing with your spouse who is also one of your best friends. Not a game you enjoy winning, but <em>playing</em>. Whatever that means to both of you.</p>
