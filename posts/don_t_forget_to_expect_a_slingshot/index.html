<p>It's one thing to give up a 30 year career and feel like the possibilities are endless. It's another to feel the pain of, essentially, the death of part of yourself. And then ya gotta expect that your wife might have her own feelings on the subject and that those feelings may not be all daffodils and triple ice cream banana splits.</p>

<p>This isn't a transcript of how the conversation went in reality. It is how it went in my heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you disappointed in me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For quitting your job without anything lined up, jeopardizing our retirement, pulling the rug out from under me, and surfacing a solid chunk of my childhood angst? 'Disappointed' might not be the ACT vocab word you're looking for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This isn't going to be a short talk, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might call that unlikely, slick.&quot;</p>
<p>The weather was cloudy, rainy, and cold. I'm one of those people whose emotions are lock-stepped to the weather like hormonal teens at a square dance. It's a big reason we moved to one of the sunniest states in the union. This is a real condition, my brain gets foggy, it's hard to concentrate, and the chances of depression in the forecast are in in the upper 80s. I was already, in a word, down.</p>
<p>What destroyed me wasn't the talk. It was lying in bed, dwelling and reviewing and reliving and--finally--trying to think of any job in my life that a) I'd enjoyed and b) had not included a fight with management or open hostility with a coworker. I could think of two.</p>
<p>I've had about twenty jobs. Which sounds absurd, but I was a contract software developer for over a decade so that meant several different clients. Before that: food service, retail, office work. I quit a lot of them, often because I had a tiff with management. I grew up thinking work was a place where you didn't get along with others, especially your bosses, who were likely idiots. It wasn't on purpose, it's just what my kid brain got taught.</p>
<p>So, it's certainly not funny when you're lying there realizing the possibilities are certainly not endless, they are constrained by a terribly serious question: what job makes money and doesn't require me working with people?</p>
<p>(That's the extreme pessimistic, depressed version of the question. But you get the idea.)</p>
<p>Software development <em>used</em> to be that for me, because I was able to work somewhat independently. Then I bought a house, got married (second and final time) and decided I wanted stable employment. Seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>There's some pretty good research showing that people's sense of well-being is strongly influenced by their sense of purpose. After a steadily worsening experience at my steady job, I announced to my wife that I wanted to find a workplace where I believed in the mission, enjoyed the culture, and wrote good code. How hard could that be to find? Almost ten years and three companies later, the answer was: not happening.</p>
<p>Why? Well, go back to my first post: about half of what I don't like in software engineering is inherent to the field. And I can't just &quot;suck it up.&quot;</p>
<p>So I broke. I lay in bed crying and heaving and my wife tried to comfort me at the same time I knew she was pissed which made me feel worse. Somehow I got to sleep. Somehow I got out of bed this morning, made my way to the local coffee shop, journaled (as the cool kids call it these days) for a couple of hours, then somehow came home to have another long talk.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was a sunny morning, my wife was seeking understanding, we both brought our hard-learned marriage therapy skills<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> to bear, leading to an emotionally exhausting and loving resolution.</p>
<p>We even resolved that it was OK for me to regularly tell her corny jokes. Like this one.</p>

<p>The rest of the day has gone well. I got out and spent some time with friends, playing the French game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque">PÃ©tanque</a>. My wife and I grocery shopped together. Our dog checked in with us to make sure everything was back to normal and that we'd still both be feeding him.</p>
<p>It was a bad day, and a bad night, and a bad morning. But now it's OK. And that's what I need to remember.</p>
