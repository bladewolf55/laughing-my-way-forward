                <div class='post-content'><p>Yesterday I applied for a job and got scheduled for an interview within an hour. Today I was supposed to have that interview. It got rescheduled.</p>
<p>Where's the humor in that?</p>

<p>At the time there wasn't much. It was kind of deflating. Definitely fed the depression cloud. The interviewer didn't let me know. I contacted <em>her</em> when she was ten minutes late. Not a great impression.</p>
<p>But you know what? I have no idea what was happening in her day. Sure, it could be she'd had a bad day with no coffee, or has CUFV<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Or, it could be far, far worse.</p>
<p>She may have come under siege by Phantom Mole Men.</p>
<p>Unknown to most of you out there, Phantom Mole Men are a real problem, an insidious plague in the lives of those who cross their paths. These creatures, barely human, invisible to the eye<a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, prey on folks--this could be you!--who sprinkle licorice Jimmies on chocolate ice cream, or prepare their taxes in early February, or carry a compact umbrella <em>just because</em>.</p>
<p>Superman faced them. You can see surprisingly well-lit live news footage of those encounters if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QygK8gYl-2M">know where to look</a>. Everyone who wore gray-scale clothes thought we'd seen the last of the fiends, but they hadn't disappeared. They'd merely vanished! Probably through the power of sub-terrestrial science, which my eighth grade teacher Mrs Glanderspoot warned me about when I kept hiding earthworms in Marla Flitkin's lunch bag.</p>
<p>But if they can't be seen (except as indicated in the footnotes. Hi, Aunt F.!), how do I know they exist at all? Because, they hide in plain sight. Here is a recent photograph of one of those infernals, masquerading as a common citizen.</p>

<p>If you see this nondescript gent attempting to blend into a crowd, run! Escape with your life!</p>
<p>The PMMs are real, my friends. Fortunately they only harass their victims for a maximum of two hours and twenty seven minutes at a time every three years. No one knows why, but some day, with your financial help, we may find out.</p>
<p>This is why I'm not too concerned about having a successful rescheduled interview. My job seekee won't be afflicted, and neither will I because I'm buying a gila monster tomorrow.</p>

<p>Well, the <em>human</em> eye. Bats can see them. So can gila monsters and my Aunt Francesca's mutant betta that's been swimming in the same aquarium since 1987.
